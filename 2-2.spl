[Enter the Ghost]

Robin:
	You are as cunning as the sum of you and the sum of the remainder of the quotient between the sum of me and Hector and the sum of an uncle and a gentle aunt and the sum of the product of me and the sum of a daughter and a charming son and the reddest fine face.

The Ghost:
	Open your mind! We shall return to scene II.
